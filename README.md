Bierman
=======

This project is written as a supplement to Gerald J. Bierman's "Factorization
Methods for Discrete Sequential Estimation".  Selected algorithms are be
illustrated in Matlab (actually developed with Octave).  Further documentation
will be developed as examples are finished.

Estimation of a static state is first illustrated.  Range only trackers are
used to estimate the location of an object within a boxed volume.  See
driver_01.m and driver_02.m - more documenation to follow...
